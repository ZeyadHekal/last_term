## 2. Software Engineering Concepts (Terminology)

### Basic Terminology (Pages 4-5)
- **What is Software?**
  - Computer program codes and associated libraries and documentation.
- **What is Engineering?**
  - Developing products using well-defined, scientific principles, tools, and methods to find cost-effective solutions to problems.
- **What is Software Engineering?**
  - An engineering discipline concerned with all aspects of software products.
- **What is an Information System (IS)?**
  - An umbrella term for systems, people, and processes designed to create, store, manipulate, distribute, and disseminate information.
  - **Note:** All software need not be information system software, but information systems are always implemented as software.
  - **Example:** 
    - Anti-virus software is not an information system.
    - Company employee payroll systems and employee master files are information systems that let you access data.

### What is Software? (Page 6)
- Computer programs and associated documentation.
- Software products may be:
  - **Generic:** Developed to be sold to a range of different customers (e.g., word processing, drawing packages, anti-virus programs).
  - **Customized:** Developed for a particular customer according to their specifications (e.g., air traffic control software for an airport).

### What is Software Process? (Page 9)
- A set of activities whose goal is the development or evaluation of software.

### What is Software Process Model? (Page 9)
- A simplified representation of a software process.

### What are the Costs of Software Engineering? (Page 9)
- In most cases:
  - 60% of costs are for development.
  - 40% of costs are for testing.

## 4. What is Software Engineering (SE)?

### Definition 1 (Page 10)
- Software Engineering (SE) is an engineering branch related to the evolution of software products using systematic, well-defined scientific principles, techniques, and procedures.
- Result: An effective and reliable software product.

### Definition 2 (Page 11)
- The methods, tools, and techniques used for developing software are called Software Engineering (SE).
- SE is an engineering discipline focused on developing cheaper, better, and faster software products (concerned with all aspects of software production).
- Software engineers are concerned with developing software products.
- SE involves:
  - **Modelling Activity**
  - **Problem-Solving Activity:** Formulate the problem, analyze it, search for solutions, choose the appropriate one, and specify it.
  - **Knowledge Acquisition Activity:** Collect data, organize it into information, and formalize it into knowledge.
- **Note:** An activity is a set of tasks performed toward a specific purpose.

## 5. Why Software Engineering?

### Software Engineers Should (Page 12)
- **Analyst & Programmer = Software Engineer**
- Adopt a systematic and organized approach to their work.
- Use appropriate tools and techniques depending on:
  - The problem to be solved.
  - The development constraints.
  - The resources available.

### Why is Software Engineering Required? (Page 13)
- To manage large software.
- For more scalability.
- Cost management.
- To manage the dynamic nature of software.
- For better quality management.

### Why Use Software Engineering? (Pages 14-17)
- **Reason 1 (Page 14):**
  - Complex and large-scale software is made by teams, not individuals.
  - Software engineering is about teams participating in solving complex or large problems that a single developer cannot solve alone.
  - Teams include developers, testers, architects, system engineers, customers, project managers, etc.
  - Software projects can be so large that careful planning is required.
- **Reason 2 (Page 15):**
  - Implementation is not just writing code but also:
    - Following guidelines.
    - Writing documentation.
    - Writing unit tests.
  - Finishing coding does not mean the project is complete:
    - For large projects, maintaining software can keep many people busy for a long time.
  - Need to learn about project management and its drawbacks.
- **Reason 3 (Page 16):**
  - Teaches us to see the big picture (patterns), providing a higher level of abstraction.
  - A fantastic way to learn from seniors, essential for designing large software systems.
  - Good software engineers need tools, and we must know about them.
- **Reason 4 (Page 17):**
  - Produces high-quality software systems.
  - **Complexity:** Many sources, but size is key:
    - UNIX contains 4 million lines of code.
    - Windows 2000 contains 10‚Å∏ lines of code.
  - Software engineering is about managing this complexity.

### Importance of Software Engineering (Page 18)
- Reduced complexity.
- Minimize software cost.
- Decrease time.
- Handling big projects.

## 7. Additional Topics

### Attributes of Good Software

#### Overview (Page 22)
- The software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be:
  - Maintainable
  - Dependable
  - Usable

#### Detailed Attributes (Page 23)
- **Maintainability:** Software must evolve to meet changing needs.
- **Dependability:** Software must be trustworthy.
- **Efficiency:** Software should not waste system resources.
- **Usability:** Software must be usable by the users for whom it was designed (i.e., easy to use).

### Key Challenges Facing Software Engineering

#### Overview (Page 22)
- Coming with increasing diversity.
- Demands for reduced delivery times.

#### 21st Century Challenges (Page 30)
- **Legacy Systems:** Old, valuable systems must be maintained and updated.

- **Delivery:** Increasing pressure for faster delivery of software.

### Accessibility, Usability, and User Experience

#### Definitions (Page 24)
- **User Experience:** The degree of satisfaction the end user has with the system or service after using it.
- **Accessibility:** The system is available and can be easily accessed by a normal person or even a disabled person.
- **Usability:** The product is easy to use.
- **Usability Testing:** Focuses on measuring the ease at which a system can be used.

#### Accessibility (Page 25)
- The condition that environments, services, processes, and objects must meet, being understandable and usable by the broadest range of people, regardless of their capabilities.

#### User Experience (Page 26)
- Meaningful and valuable when a product, service, or system is:
  - Useful (original content that satisfies a need).
  - Usable (easy to use).
  - Desirable (produces positive emotions via image, identity, brand, and design).
  - Locatable (accessible to people with disabilities).
  - Credible (users have confidence in the product).
  - Valuable (generates added value).

### System Usability Scale (SUS)

#### Overview (Page 27)
- The SUS questionnaire contains 10 questions about:
  - Ease of learning
  - Efficiency
  - Ease of memorization
  - Occurrence of execution errors
  - Level of satisfaction
- Each question uses a five-point scale (1 = totally disagree, 5 = totally agree).
- SUS provides a score from 0 to 100:
  - 85 or higher = exceptional usability.
  - Below 70 = unacceptable usability.

#### Detailed SUS Metrics (Page 28)
- **Efficiency:** How fast the user can accomplish a task after learning the interface.
- **Ease of Memorization:** How easily a user can re-establish competence after a period of no use.
- **Minimization of Errors:** Level of seriousness of mistakes and ease of recovery.
- **Satisfaction:** How pleasant the interface is to use.
- **Ease of Learning:** How easy it is to perform simple tasks the first time.

#### SUS Questions (Page 29)
1. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.
2. I felt very confident using the system.
3. I found the system very cumbersome to use.
4. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
5. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
6. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
7. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
8. I thought the system was easy to use.
9. I found the system unnecessarily complex.
10. I think that I would like to use this system frequently.

### Why Projects Fail?

#### Statistics (Page 31)
- 42% of all corporate IS projects were abandoned before completion.
- 53% of all U.S. government IS projects were abandoned.
- Many systems that aren‚Äôt abandoned are:
  - Delivered significantly late.
  - Cost far more than planned.
  - Have fewer features than originally planned.
- Generally, over 50% of projects are either canceled or over 100% late.
- Even Microsoft has a history of failures and overdue projects (e.g., Windows 1.0, Windows 95).

#### Causes of Failure (Page 32)
- Unrealistic schedules.
- Inappropriate staffing.
- Changing requirements.
- Poor quality work.

#### Flynn Approach to IS Project Failures (Page 33)
- **Two Types:**
  - **Quality Problems:**
    - Quality means fitness for purpose or meeting all user requirements.
  - **Productivity Problems:**
    - Will the product be delivered?
    - Will it be delivered in time to be useful?
    - Will it be affordable?
- **Flynn Suggestion:** (Not detailed in the document)

#### Quality Problem Reasons (Page 34)
- The wrong problem is addressed (no clear requirements).
- Wider influences are neglected (e.g., organizational culture).
- Analysis is carried out incorrectly (poor skilled team).
- Project undertaken for the wrong reason.

#### Productivity Problem Reasons (Page 35)
- Users change their minds (requirements).
- External events change the environment.
- Implementation is not feasible (too late).
- Poor project control (poor managers).

### Software Engineering (SE) Goals

#### Primary Goals (Page 36)
- Meeting user‚Äôs needs (Requirements analysis or requirements engineering):
  - Find out what the customer or user needs.
  - Establish clearly what the user wants.
- Low cost of production.
- High performance (efficiency).

#### Continued Goals (Page 37)
- **Portability:**
  - Transferring the software product from one type of computer to another with minimum effort.
- **Low Cost of Maintenance:**
  - Any effort put into software after it has been written and put into operation.
  - **Maintenance Types:**
    - **Remedial Maintenance:** Fixing bugs (correcting faults in the software).
    - **Adaptive Maintenance:** Altering software due to changed user needs, computer, OS, or programming language.
  - Maintenance is a consequence of inadequate testing.

#### Continued Goals (Page 38)
- **Delivery on Time.**
- **High Reliability:**
  - Software works and continues to work without crashing or doing something undesirable.
  - **Bug Types:**
    - **Error:** A wrong decision made during software development.
    - **Fault:** A problem that may cause software to depart from its intended behavior.
    - **Failure:** An event when software departs from its intended behavior.
    - **Relationship:** An error causes one or more faults; a fault can cause one or more failures.

#### Maintenance vs. Reliability (Page 39)
- (Content appears incomplete in the original document, filled with repeated "Œ±" symbols.)

### Software Engineering Blueprints (Page 40)
- Specifying software problems and solutions is like cartoon strip writing.
- Most of us are not artists, so we use UML symbols instead.

### UML (Unified Modeling Language)

#### Introduction (Page 41)
- Teams need a language to communicate effectively (UML).
- Previous courses taught languages like Java or C++ to turn ideas into code, but ideas are independent of language.
- UML describes code independently of language and teaches thinking at a higher level of abstraction.
- UML is an invaluable communication and documentation tool.

#### System Components (Page 42)
- **Actors:** Agents external to the system that interact with it.
- **Concepts/Objects:** Agents working inside the system to make it function.
- **Use Cases:** Scenarios for using the system.

### Self-Test Question (Page 43)
- Flynn categorizes project failures into productivity and quality problems. Indicate which type applies to each reason:
  a) The user changes the requirements ‚Üí **Productivity**
  b) The wrong problem is addressed ‚Üí **Quality**
  c) Analysis is carried out incorrectly ‚Üí **Quality**
  d) Poor project control ‚Üí **Productivity**
  e) Implementation is not feasible ‚Üí **Productivity**
