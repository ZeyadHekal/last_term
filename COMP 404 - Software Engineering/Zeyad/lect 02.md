## 1. Introduction to Software Engineering (SE) as a Layered Technology (Page 1)
- **Definition:** Software Engineering (SE) is a layered technology because it accomplishes software development in three successive layers or steps: Processes, Methods, and Tools.
- **Layered Technologies:**
  - **Tools**
  - **Methods**
  - **Process**

### Detailed Layers (Page 2)
- **Process:**
  - The fundamental layer that sets the groundwork for software engineering.
  - Facilitates reasonable and timely development of computer software.
  - Substantiated as a framework for effective delivery of software engineering technology.
  - Lays the foundation for software project management and provides technical methods and tools to yield products like data, reports, documents, and models.
  - Sets milestones and guidelines to cope with project deadlines, quality standards, and sudden changes (e.g., changes in user requirements).
- **Methods:**
  - The layer above the process layer, defining a set of methods for software development.
  - Includes regimes such as requirement analysis, design modeling, code development, software testing, software product implementation, and software maintenance.
  - Follows predefined fundamental rules of product design and modeling.
- **Tools:**
  - The topmost layer, defining a set of tools for software development.
  - Tools may be automated or semi-automated to speed up the development cycle.
  - **Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE):** An integration of tools including software, hardware, and databases.

## 2. Software Process (Page 3)
- **Definition:** A group of activities, actions, and tasks defined as follows:
  - **Activity:** A general objective, irrespective of application domain, project size, or effort complexity.
  - **Action:** A set of tasks that deliver a major work product.
  - **Task:** A trivial but thoroughly stated objective.
- **Standard Process Framework Activities:**
  - **Communication:** Exchange of views between the customer and software engineer; the customer states requirements as the basis for software development.
  - **Planning:** Development of a software project plan that defines scheduled tasks, projected risks, and required resources.
  - **Modeling:** Designing prototypes or rough drafts to better understand user requirements.
  - **Construction:** Code generation and testing to overcome errors in the code.
  - **Deployment:** Configuring the software at the user end, where it is evaluated by the user and feedback is provided to the software engineer.

## 3. Software Engineering Concepts

### Graphical Representation (Page 4)
- **Project:** A software system to be developed (Goal).
- **Components:**
  - Activities (Phases) + Actions → Produce Tasks
  - Resources
  - Work Product
  - System
  - Model
  - Document
  - Participant
  - Time
  - Equipment

### Definitions (Page 5)
- **System:** The underlying reality (e.g., a ticket distributor for an underground train).
- **Model:** Any abstraction of reality, a pattern, or a type/design of a product (e.g., schematics of electrical wiring).
- **Schedule, Budget:** (Mentioned but not elaborated).
- **Work Product:** An artifact produced during development.
  - **Internal Work Product:** For project’s internal consumption.
  - **Deliverable:** For the client.

### Why Do We Model? (Page 6)
- Models are representations that aid in defining, analyzing, and communicating a set of concepts.
- System models support analysis, specification, design, verification, and validation of a system, and communicate certain information.
- **Example:** A woman modeling a designer’s clothes at a fashion show to show potential buyers.

### Additional Concepts (Page 7)
- **Resources:** Assets used to accomplish work.
- **Task:** An atomic unit of work that can be managed.
- **Activities:** A set of tasks performed toward a specific purpose.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Delivery:** Purpose is to install the system.
    - **Management:** Purpose is to monitor and control the project to meet its goals (budget, deadline, quality).

## 4. Notations, Methods, and Methodologies (Page 8)
- **Method:** A repeatable technique for solving a specific problem (e.g., a sorting algorithm for sorting elements).
- **Methodology:** A collection of methods for solving a class of problems (e.g., a seafood cookbook for preparing seafood).
- **Notation:** A graphical or textual set of rules for representing a model.
  - **Examples:**
    - Roman alphabet for representing words.
    - UML (Unified Modeling Language) as an object-oriented notation for representing models.

### Reasons to Use Methodology (Page 9)

## 5. System Modeling and UML (Unified Modeling Language)

### Software Engineering Blueprints (Page 12)
- Specifying software problems and solutions is like cartoon strip writing.
- Since most are not artists, UML symbols are used instead.
- **UML:** A graphical language used in object-oriented development, including several types of system models providing different views of a system.

### System Components (Page 13)
- **Actors:** Agents external to the system that interact with it.
- **Concepts/Objects:** Agents working inside the system to make it function.
- **Use Cases:** Scenarios for using the system; identifies actors involved and names the type of interaction.

### System Modeling (Page 14)
- The process of developing abstract models of a system, each offering a distinctive viewpoint.
- Systems are represented using UML, a graphical notation.

### UML Introduction (Page 15)
- Teams need a communication language (UML).
- Previous courses taught languages like Java or C++ to turn ideas into code, but ideas are language-independent.
- UML describes code independently of language and teaches thinking at a higher level of abstraction.
- UML is an invaluable communication and documentation tool.

### UML Diagram Types (Page 16)
- Divided into two categories:
  - **Structure Diagrams:** Represent the static structure of the system (e.g., class and package diagrams).
  - **Behavior Diagrams:** Depict dynamic behavior and changes over time (e.g., use case, state, activity, and sequence diagrams).

### UML Perspectives (Page 17)
- Different models represent the system from various perspectives:
  1. **External Perspective:** Models the context or environment of the system.
  2. **Interaction Perspective:** Models interactions between the system and its environment or between system components.
  3. **Structural Perspective:** Models the organization of the system or the structure of processed data.
  4. **Behavioral Perspective:** Models dynamic behavior and responses to events.

### UML Diagram Examples (Page 18)
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Show interactions between actors, the system, and system components.
- **Class Diagrams:** Show object classes and their associations.
- **State Diagrams:** Show how the system reacts to internal and external events.
- **Use Case and Sequence Diagrams:** Describe interactions between users/other systems and the system being designed; use cases focus on external actors, while sequence diagrams add details about system object interactions.

### UML Types Continued (Page 19)
- **Use Case Diagram:** Describes functional requirements via use cases, simulating intended functionality and environment interactions.
- **Sequence Diagram:** Depicts interactions between actors, the system, and components.
- **Activity Diagram:** Visualizes processes with sequential activities, including choice, iteration, and concurrency.
- **State Diagram:** Depicts the system’s response to internal and external events.

### Use Case Diagram Details (Page 20)
- **Systems:** Represented by a rectangle with the system name at the top (e.g., website, application, games).
- **Actors:** External objects (e.g., person, organization, device) using the system to achieve a goal, represented by a stick figure.
  - **Primary Actor:** Initiates system use (left side).
  - **Secondary Actor:** Reacts to the system (right side).
- **Use Cases:** Oval shapes representing actions/tasks within the system; arranged in logical order.
- **Relationships:** Solid lines showing actor interactions with use cases.

### Use Case Examples
- **Inventory Management System (Page 21):** Three use cases (not specified).
- **Patient Information System (Page 22):** Some use cases for the system.
- **Medical Receptionist in Patient Information System (Page 23):** All use cases involving the actor ‘Medical Receptionist’.
- **Weather Control Station (Page 24):**
  - Report weather: Send weather data to the weather information system.
  - Report status: Send status information to the weather information system.
  - Restart: Restart the system if shut down.
  - Shutdown: Shut down the weather station.
  - Reconfigure: Reconfigure the weather station software.
  - Powersave: Put the weather station into power-saving mode.
  - Remote control: Send control commands to any subsystem.

### Relationship Types (Page 25)
- **Include:** Dependency where the base use case requires the included use case to complete; executed every time the base use case runs (dashed line from base to included).
- **Extend:** The extend use case happens sometimes, not always, based on criteria (dashed line from extend to base).
- **Note:** Multiple base use cases can point to the same included or extended use case.
- **Generalization/Inheritance:** Relation between a general and specialized use case (e.g., “make a payment” from checking or savings account).

### Illustrated Example (Page 26)
- (No specific details provided; placeholder for an illustration).

### Extend Example (Page 27)
- **Place Equipment Order → Add Equipment to Store:** Extending the core use case of adding equipment if it doesn’t exist, ordered, and added when delivered.

### Banking System Use Case Diagram (Page 28)
- **Actors:**
  - **Customer:** Downloads and uses the banking app (primary actor).
  - **Bank:** Provides information (e.g., transactions, account balances) and reacts to customer actions (secondary actor).
